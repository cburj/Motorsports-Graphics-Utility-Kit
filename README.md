## About The Project

# ⚠ UN-MAINTAINED REPOSITORY ⚠
<p>The Motorsports Graphics Utility Kit (MGU-K) is a solution for racing/sim-racing productions to display leadboards and statistics, where it may be very difficult (or impossible) to get data from the event onto viewers' screens. This was a lockdown project over a couple of weeks to keep me busy after work. I have officially cancelled the development of this project as I made some fairly badchoices early on. However, I will be producing an MGU-K V2 very soon, using some aspects of my Final Year University Project to help with development.</p>
<br/>
<p>The app currently uses AJAX for fetching/updating the tower elements (laps, flags, positions, lap times etc) by calling PHP functions if there is data to be updated.</p>
